## 1.0.6 (16.7.2018)

Code cleanup:

- Updated dev package versions
- Recompiled with newer js uglify (this in turn reduced filesize by 7 bytes.. Yay)
- Replaces tabs from source

## 1.0.5 (9.7.2016)

Bug fixes:

- Text filtering can now be set as case sensitive or insensitive
- tinySelect main div is now given id, if original select has id. The new id is original + _ts
- Updated qunit from 1.x to 2.x and added some basic tests against jquery 1.x , 2.x and 3.x
